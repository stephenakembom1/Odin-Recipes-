        <img src="images/8179668-816c90a1096444a0b6f1caae7debd95d.webp">

        <p>I was looking for a recipe for a taco pizza, but couldn't find exactly the kind I was wanting so I decide to wing it and came up with this one myself</p>
        <p>The results were great.</p>
        <P>My husband said it was the best one he'd ever had! For an extra treat, top with lettuce, tomato and sour cream.</P>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><a>10 fluid ounces warm water</a></li>
            <li><a>¾ teaspoon salt</a></li>
            <li><a>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</a></li>
            <li><a>4 cups all-purpose flour</a></li>
            <li><a>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</a></li>
            <li><a>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</a></li>
            <li><a>¾ cup water</a></li>
            <li><a>1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix, divided</a></li>
            <li><a>1 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste</a></li>
            <li><a>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</a></li>
            <li><a>1 (16 ounce) can fat-free refried beans</a></li>
            <li><a>⅓ cup salsa</a></li>
            <li><a>¼ cup chopped onion</a></li>
            <li><a>½ pound ground beef</a></li>
            <li><a>4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><a>Add water, salt, oil, flour and yeast to your bread machine in the order listed. Select the dough cycle. Check dough after it has been mixing for a few minutes. If it is too dry and not mixing, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it is mixing and has a nice dough consistency. You want the dough to be pliable but not</a></li>
            <li><a>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine tomato paste, water, and 3/4 of the package of taco seasoning mix. Stir in chili powder and cayenne pepper; set aside. In another bowl, mix refried beans, salsa, and onion; set aside.</a></li>
            <li><a>Cook ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until evenly brown; drain excess fat. Season with the remaining 1/4 package of taco seasoning and a small amount of water. Simmer for a few minutes, then remove from heat.</a></li>
            <li><a>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</a></li>
            <li><a>When the dough cycle is finished, remove dough from the machine. Divide dough in half, and pat into two 12-inch pans. Spread a layer of bean mixture on top of dough, then a layer of the tomato mixture. Sprinkle with seasoned beef and top with Cheddar cheese.</a></li>
            <li><a>Bake in preheated oven until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes, turning pizzas halfway through baking.</a></li>
